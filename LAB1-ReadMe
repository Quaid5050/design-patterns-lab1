Title: Design Patterns Lab 1 Overview - OOP Concepts Implementation

Lab Name: Design Patterns Lab 1
Student Name: Quaid Ahmed
Registration Number: FA20-BSE-034

Overview:
In the Design Patterns Lab 1, the primary objective was to gain hands-on experience in implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The lab task involved logging into the subexpert.com platform, selecting Lab Task 1, and applying various OOP principles, including abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, and both dynamic and static polymorphism. Below is a step-by-step summary of the tasks completed during the lab:

Step 1: Login to https://subexpert.com/
   - Opened a web browser.
   - Navigated to the subexpert.com website.
   - Successfully logged into the platform using the provided credentials.

Step 2: Select Lab Task 1
   - Located and selected "Lab Task 1" on the subexpert.com platform.

Step 3: Learn and Implement OOP Concepts
   - Under the guidance of the lab instructions or materials provided, thoroughly studied and understood the following OOP concepts:
      1. Abstraction: Learned how to abstract complex systems into simplified models.
      2. Interfaces: Explored the concept of defining contracts for classes to implement.
      3. Inheritance: Understood the concept of creating new classes based on existing ones.
      4. Dynamic Polymorphism: Learned about runtime method binding and polymorphic behavior.
      5. Static Polymorphism: Explored compile-time method overloading and polymorphism.

Step 4: Practical Implementation
   - Applied the learned OOP concepts in practical scenarios or code examples as instructed in Lab Task 1.

Step 5: Completion
   - Successfully completed the tasks and exercises related to OOP concepts in Lab Task 1 on subexpert.com.

This lab provided valuable hands-on experience in implementing OOP principles, which are fundamental in software development. It helped reinforce the understanding of abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, and both dynamic and static polymorphism. This knowledge will be beneficial in future programming endeavors.
